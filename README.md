# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS (SHOOT!)

## Instructions

You goal is to implement rock, paper, scissors, shoot! (aka "roshambo").[RPS wikipedia][1]  This is meant to be an open ended project, you can chose to implement your code how you see fit as long as your project accomplishes the following game mechanics:

1. A player can click on the rock, paper, or scissors button to choose their move each round.  The player's image should be updated to reflect what choice the player made.  (Feel free to add animation or a transition here!)
2. Once the player makes their choice, the computer will randomly pick its move, and then computer's image should be updated to reflect that choice. (again animation/transition potential)
3. After the player and computer have both taken a turn, the game outcome needs to be decided and the Wins/Ties/Losses counts needs to be updated.
4. The reset stats button should reset the Wins/Ties/Losses counts back to zero.

## Files in Starter

1. `rockPaperScissors.js` is empty.  This is where you need to implement all of the game mechanics.  Feel free to make other JS files if needed and import them to this file.
2. `index.html` has been started for you.  You can modify this file as needed.
3. `index.css` has also been started for you with some preliminary styles.  You can also modidy this file as needed.
4. `images folder` contains rock, paper, and scissors .png image files for you to utilize in your game play.
