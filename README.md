# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS (SHOOT!) (optional project)

## Instructions

You goal is to implement Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot! (aka "roshambo"). [RPS
wikipedia][1]  
This is meant to be an open ended project, you can chose to implement your code
how you see fit as long as your project accomplishes the following game
mechanics:

1. A player can click on the Rock, Raper, or Scissors button to choose their
   move each round.  The player's image should be updated to reflect what choice
   the player made.  (Feel free to add animation or a transition here!)
2. Once the player makes their choice, the computer will randomly pick its move,
   and then the computer's image should be updated to reflect that choice. (again
   animation/transition potential)
3. After the player and computer have both taken a turn, the game outcome needs
   to be decided (and maybe somehow announced) and the Wins/Ties/Losses counts
   need to be updated.
   - Rock breaks Scissors
   - Paper covers Rock
   - Scissors cut Paper
   - If both players pick the same choice its a tie
4. The reset stats button should reset the Wins/Ties/Losses counts back to zero.

Feel free to be creative with this project as long as you meet the above
requirements!  

Some Tips or Hints...

- Have fun with this project!
- You should probably use OOP or some helper functions, but not required
- Does the computer have to be random or can it be a bit smarter? [or a lot
  smarter?][2]
- It might be cool if the hand gesture images faced each other, like when you
  play with another person?
- Speaking of another player, can you make it a 2 player game?
- Do you like "The Big Bang Theory"?  There are 2 extra images... [game
  rules][3]
- Lots of styling could be improved upon...

## Files in Starter

1. `rockPaperScissors.js` is empty.  This is where you need to implement all of
   the game mechanics.  Feel free to make other JS files if needed and import
   them to this file.
2. `index.html` has been started for you.  You can modify this file as needed.
3. `index.css` has also been started for you with some preliminary styles.  You
   can also modidy this file as needed.
4. The `images folder` contains rock, paper, and scissors .png image files for
   you to utilize in your game play.
